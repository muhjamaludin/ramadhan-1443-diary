# Fix rendering Picture in Jekyll
I think the picture can appear on markdown format. In local development, it is solve, but when I publish, the github pages won't appear my picture. Why ?
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}assets/img/Screenshot 2022-04-04 at 16-12-18 Day 01.png" alt="Not appear picture githu pages">
The code that I follow before from [docs static-files](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/static-files/). I am using for loop and conditional to render the path of the images.
```ruby
{ % assign image_files = site.static_files | where: "image", true % }
{ % for myimage in image_files % }
  { % if myimage.path contains 'var_lib_gems' % }
    ![Permission Error]({{ myimage.path }})
  { % endif % }
{ % endfor % }
```
Appear in local but not in github pages. After browsing solution, found [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28820917/jekyll-on-github-pages-not-displaying-images-and-has-broken-links) that refer to [docs jekyll for github pages](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/#project-page-url-structure). Instead using for loop and find path, you can use directly from `site.baseurl` like this
```
<img src="{ { sites.baseurl } }assets/img/image.jgp" alt="load image">
```

# Update Blog UI
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}assets/img/Screenshot 2022-04-04 at 16-33-54 Your awesome title.png" alt="first day UI">
The first day is just to serve platform that I can write my notes. Look on top, appeance if very minimalist and default. The second day I want to update the UI, name, title etc. In day 1 I almost used default settings from jekyll tutorial. 😁
1. Change title
  - your awesome title >> Masjams Ramadhan 1443 Diary \
  Title refect my name and content of the blog.
2. Change convention name each day
  - Day 01 >> 1 Ramadhan 1443 \
  It is look like more serious title and easy to understand the date. I think 😂.
3. Update email
  - your_email@example >> 74maludin@gmail.com \
  from default to my currenctly active my email 💪.

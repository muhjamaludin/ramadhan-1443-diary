## Deployment this site with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
Reason why I choose this tools than others like (hugo, docusaurus, etc) to manage my note during ramadhan this year - insyaAllah - because jekyll bundle and support by github. You can get the tutorial officially from [Github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) to serve the deployment. I use it too.

### The steps I did until this site was deployed
1. Install Ruby & Gem \
I use Windows SubsystemLinux in my local development and I didn't install ruby at all. So the first things is installing Ruby because Jekyll using gem package manager which one comes from ruby. I use docs from [ruby-lang.org/id](https://www.ruby-lang.org/id/documentation/installation/#apt) to install in my Debian WSL.
```bash
$ sudo apt install ruby-full
```
Booms. You have installed Ruby and the package manager's `Gem`. Verify instalation with versioning.
```
$ ruby --version
ruby 2.7.4p191 (2021-07-07 revision a21a3b7d23) [x86_64-linux-gnu]
$ gem --version
3.2.5
```

2. Installing Jekyll and Bundler \
After ruby and gem ready. Now, I must install __jekyll__ and __bundle__ via **gem**. 
```
$ gem install jekyll bundler
```
But, I got error 'FilePermissionError'.
```
ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::FilePermissionError)
    You don't have write permissions for the /var/lib/gems/2.7.0 directory.
```
Hmmm, should I installing with **Sudo** ? I think that is not a good idea. Installing _jekyll_ and _bundler_ must not in Sudo. It's like `npm install <package>` that not required **Sudo**. I found solution in [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37720892/you-dont-have-write-permissions-for-the-var-lib-gems-2-3-0-directory) 
![Stackoverflow](/assets/images/Screenshot%202022-04-04%20at%2001-52-09%20You%20don't%20have%20write%20permissions%20for%20the%20_var_lib_gems_2.3.0%20directory.png){:class="img-responsive"}.
I must change the _GEM HOME_, export ruby bin and activate again `.bashrc`.

3. Serve Jekyll in local follow [setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) tutorial \
I never use jekyll to make static site generator before, so I choose this official tutorial to guide me deploy jekyll SSG with Github Actions. \
Steps: 
  - Creating repository in github âœ…
  - Creating your site âš” \
    step 1 - 11 is easy, but in step 12 
    ```
    $ bundle install
    ```
    some error happened.
    ```bash
    $ bundle install
    [!] There was an error parsing `Gemfile`: Illformed requirement ["~> GITHUB-PAGES-VERSION"]. Bundler cannot continue.
    #  from /home/masjams/code/github/ramadhan-1443-diary/docs/Gemfile:11
    #  -------------------------------------------
    #  # gem "jekyll", "~> 4.2.2"
    >  gem "github-pages", "~> GITHUB-PAGES-VERSION", group: :jekyll_plugins
    #  # This is the default theme for new Jekyll sites. You may change this to anything you like.
    ```

    code `"~> GITHUB-PAGES-VERSION"` made error. Follow instruction from [github pages discussion](https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/351), I changed `"~> GITHUB-PAGES-VERSION"` to `"104"`, error on top is disappear, but got new one ðŸ˜….
    ```
    $ bundle install
    Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/...........
    Resolving dependencies...
    Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem "jekyll-feed":
      In Gemfile:
        jekyll-feed (~> 0.12)

        github-pages (= 104) was resolved to 104, which depends on
      jekyll-feed (= 0.8.0)
    ```
    I don't know what going on. Looks like now error in _jekyll-feed_. So try changed `"104'` to `"0.8.0"` suitable with the _jekyll-feed_ which made error. The error is disappear, but got new error about github pages.
    ```
    $ bundle install
    Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/...........
    Could not find gem 'github-pages (= 0.8.0)' in rubygems repository https://rubygems.org/ or installed locally.

    The source contains the following gems matching 'github-pages':
      * github-pages-1
      * github-pages-3
      * github-pages-4
      ---
      * github-pages-225
    ```
    I thought to use the latest github-pages version on. So, i choose to change again the line with
    ```
    >  gem "github-pages", "225", group: :jekyll_plugins
    ```
    And Yeay Succesfully appear.

4. Deploying in Github Pages \
  After struggling in step 12. I continue step in [github docs tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll). Some different step is in _Setting -> Source_. I change from `branch: gh-pages >> /` to `branch: gh-pages >> /docs` suit with structure of this repository. \
  And again trouble happened. The CSS not working ðŸ˜¥.

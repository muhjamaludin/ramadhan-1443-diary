## Deployment this site with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
Reason why I choose this tools than others like (hugo, docusaurus, etc) to manage my note during ramadhan this year - insyaAllah - because jekyll bundle and support by github. You can get the tutorial officially from [Github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) to serve the deployment. I use it too.

### The steps I did until this site was deployed
1. Install Ruby & Gem \
I use Windows SubsystemLinux in my local development and I didn't install ruby at all. So the first things is installing Ruby because Jekyll using gem package manager which one comes from ruby. I use docs from [ruby-lang.org/id](https://www.ruby-lang.org/id/documentation/installation/#apt) to install in my Debian WSL.
```bash
$ sudo apt install ruby-full
```
Booms. You have installed Ruby and the package manager's `Gem`. Verify instalation with versioning.
```
$ ruby --version
ruby 2.7.4p191 (2021-07-07 revision a21a3b7d23) [x86_64-linux-gnu]
$ gem --version
3.2.5
```

2. Installing Jekyll and Bundler \
After ruby and gem ready. Now, I must install __jekyll__ and __bundle__ via **gem**. 
```
$ gem install jekyll bundler
```
But, I got error 'FilePermissionError'.
```
ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::FilePermissionError)
    You don't have write permissions for the /var/lib/gems/2.7.0 directory.
```
Hmmm, should I installing with **Sudo** ? I think that is not a good idea. Installing _jekyll_ and _bundler_ must not in Sudo. It's like `npm install <package>` that not required **Sudo**. I found solution in [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37720892/you-dont-have-write-permissions-for-the-var-lib-gems-2-3-0-directory) 
![Stackoverflow](/assets/images/Screenshot%202022-04-04%20at%2001-52-09%20You%20don't%20have%20write%20permissions%20for%20the%20_var_lib_gems_2.3.0%20directory.png){:class="img-responsive"}.
I must change the _GEM HOME_, export ruby bin and activate again `.bashrc`.

3. Serve Jekyll in local follow [setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) tutorial \
I never use jekyll to make static site generator before, so I choose this official tutorial to guide me deploy jekyll SSG with Github Actions. \
Steps: 
  - Creating repository in github ✅
  - Creating your site ⚔ \
    step 1 - 11 is easy, but in step 12 
    ```
    $ bundle install
    ```
    some error happened.

    code `"~> GITHUB-PAGES-VERSION"` made error.

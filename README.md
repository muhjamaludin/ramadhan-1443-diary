I try to make some note what I have learned during the Ramadhan 1443 H or in year 2022. Goals for the repository is 
- to track my learning process,
- to get positive motivation on special's months of islamic months. \
I hope  this fasting month will give blessings to me and my family, Aamiin. Another goal is for me to practive writing in English because of my native language is Java and common languange is Indonesian. But for the programmers, I think English is a main tools to collaboration around the world. \
So I'm sorry if I wrote a lot of mistakes.
